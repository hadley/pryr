\title{Track if an object is copied}
\usage{
track_copy(var, env = parent.frame(), quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{variable name (unquoted)}

\item{env}{environment name in which to track changes}

\item{quiet}{if \code{FALSE}, prints a message on change; if \code{FALSE}
only the return value of the function is used}
}
\value{
a zero-arg function, that when called returns a boolean indicating
  if the object has changed since the last time this function was called
}
\description{
The title is somewhat misleading: rather than checking if an object is
modified, this really checks to see if a name points to the same object.
}
\examples{
a <- 1:5
track_a <- track_copy(a)
track_a()
a[3] <- 3L
track_a()
a[3] <- 3
track_a()
rm(a)
track_a()
}
