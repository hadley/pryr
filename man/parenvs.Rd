\title{Given an environment or object, return an \code{envlist} of its
parent environments.}
\usage{
parenvs(e = parent.frame(), all = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{An environment or other object.}

\item{all}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), stop at the global
environment or the empty environment. If \code{TRUE}, print all
parents, stopping only at the empty environment (which is the
top-level environment).}
}
\description{
If \code{e} is not specified, it will start with environment from which
the function was called.
}
\examples{
# Print the current environment and its parents
parenvs()

# Print the parent environments of the load_all function
e <- parenvs(parenvs)
e

# Get all parent environments, going all the way to empty env
e <- parenvs(parenvs, TRUE)
e

# Print e with paths
print(e, path = TRUE)

# Print the first 6 environments in the envlist
e[1:6]

# Print just the parent environment of load_all.
# This is an envlist with one element.
e[1]

# Pull that environment out of the envlist and see what's in it.
e[[1]]
ls(e[[1]], all.names = TRUE)
