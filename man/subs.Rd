\title{A version of substitute that works in the global environment.}
\usage{
subs(x, env = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a quoted call}

\item{env}{an environment, or something that behaves like an environment
(like a list or data frame), or a reference to an environment (like a
positive integer or name, see \code{\link{as.environment}} for more
details)}
}
\description{
This version of \code{\link{substitute}} is more suited for interactive
exploration because it will perform substitution in the global environment:
the regular version has a special case for the global environment where it
effectively works like \code{\link{quote}}
}
\section{Substitution rules}{


Formally, substitution takes place by examining each name in the expression.
If the name refers to:

\itemize{

 \item an ordinary variable, it's replaced by the value of the variable.

 \item a promise, it's replaced by the expression associated with the
    promise.

 \item \code{...}, it's replaced by the contents of \code{...}
}
}

\examples{
a <- 1
b <- 2

substitute(a + b)
subs(a + b)
}
