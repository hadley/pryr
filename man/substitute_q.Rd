\name{substitute_q}
\alias{substitute_q}
\title{A version of substitute that evaluates its first argument.}
\usage{
substitute_q(x, env)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a quoted call}

\item{env}{an environment, or something that behaves like an environment
(like a list or data frame), or a reference to an environment (like a
positive integer or name, see \code{\link{as.environment}} for more
details)}
}
\description{
This version of substitute is needed because \code{substitute} does not
evaluate it's first argument, and it's often useful to be able to modify
a quoted call.
}
\examples{
x <- quote(a + b)
substitute(x, list(a = 1, b = 2))
substitute_q(x, list(a = 1, b = 2))
}
